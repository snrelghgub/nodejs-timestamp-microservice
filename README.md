# Timestamp Microservice 

https://timestamp-mservice.herokuapp.com/

## Project Description 
My timestamp microservice is a full-stack JavaScript app that allows a client (browser) to submit a GET request to an Express server in Node.js. It was developed to seamlessly & efficiently respond to the client with a valid JSON object. If the request made by the client is valid, it responds with its correct corresponding timestamp otherwise a response is still provided but to raise the issue & error for the client appropriately.
